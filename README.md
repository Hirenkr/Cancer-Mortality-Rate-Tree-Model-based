# Cancer-Mortality-Rate-Tree-Model-based
Refer to the cancer data and withhold data from the Cancer Mortality repository. For that project we tried Linear Regression and KNN. We will explore performance improvement from more flexible methods in this project.

## Instructions
Developed Decision tree (with pruning), Random Forest, Boosting based models to predict cancer mortality. 
Performed hyper parameter tuning using 10-fold Cross Validation (CV). 
Reported performance of best model on the holdout data.
